# Navi-Slackbot
For saving links

Hey! I'm a SlackBot for managing links. When invited to a channel, I go through all past links and collect them into a GitHub .md files. I run on Heroku and keep an ear out for any new links added to a channel. 

You can get my attention by typing @Navi followed by a command. For example: <br/>
@Navi links<br/>

I have the following commands:
* "has joined the group"/"has joined the channel" - how I know to go get the history of a new channel I'm invited too. You can also manually enter either command to cause me to go reget the history of a channel. It can take me a while, though, so please only call this if you need to! 
* "find all" - I'll send you a gist that includes links to all the channel gists that I've collected
* "links" - I'll send you a link to that particular channel's gist
* "hey" - listen!

If you're looking for all my links, you can find them by clicking [here](https://gist.github.com/ElBell/4a06315bf0a5593b9ff2456bcb7ef5fb)
